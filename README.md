# Heart-Disease-Detection

Welcome to the Heart Disease Prediction repository! This project focuses on using machine learning to predict whether an individual is suffering from heart disease based on various health indicators. 

## Overview

Heart disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Early detection and intervention can significantly improve outcomes for patients. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of an individual having heart disease based on their health parameters.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains various attributes such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other health indicators. The target variable indicates whether the individual has heart disease or not, with values:
- 1: Indicates presence of heart disease
- 0: Indicates absence of heart disease

## Approach

1. **Data Collection**: Obtain a dataset containing relevant health parameters and corresponding heart disease labels.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data, handle missing values, and preprocess features as necessary.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the dataset to understand the distributions of features, correlations, and potential patterns.
4. **Model Training**: Utilize various machine learning algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Naive Bayes to build predictive models.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Prediction**: Deploy the trained model to predict whether new individuals are likely to have heart disease based on their health parameters.
